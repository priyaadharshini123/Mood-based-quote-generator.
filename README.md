# Mood-based-quote-generator.
* Open vs code and  and create a separate folder for the project.
* Open that folder in vscode and create three files named as index.html,style.css,script.js and nature.jpeg
* Next paste the corresponding codes in the files 
* Next goto html file and  right click open with live server

* After clicking submit button a another pop up box will open asking  to enter the user name after entering and clicking submit it will display a quote based on the mood entered by the user.
* Every time when we run it will change the quote that is displayed.
* If we give a wrong mood  or some other words it will display we can't predict the mood try again later it will display .
* I also provide the sample output image for wrong mood.
* This is a simple  quote generator based on mood project.
